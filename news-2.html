			<h2>Purple Mattress Review and Prices</h2>
			<p class="description">The Purple Mattress is best known for its hyper-elastic polymer Grid, which gives it an unusual feel.</p>
			<p>The Purple Mattress places No. 3 in our rating of the Best Overall Mattresses of 2022. It also earns the No. 3 spot in our Best Online Mattresses of 2022 ranking.</p>
			<p>Purple is a major player in the direct-to-consumer mattress world. It is most known for its unique Purple Grid, the brand’s alternative to memory foam.  </p>
			<p>The Purple Mattress is a mid-priced bed-in-box mattress that features a unique top layer of proprietary hyper-elastic polymer in the shape of a grid.  </p>
			<p>This Purple Grid offers pressure relief for your hips and shoulders while supporting your spine. Its temperature-neutral gel can also keep you cool and comfortable while you sleep.</p>
			<p>Even though the Purple is made with foam and not springs, it doesn’t necessarily feel like an all-foam mattress. The gel grid is designed to provide support without pressure by suspending your weight through the crosshatched material.</p>
			<p>This makes it a good choice for side sleepers who need pressure relief on their shoulders and hips, though it’s not the right fit for everyone. At first, the floating sensation of the gel grid may feel a bit strange. After a few nights of sleeping on it, however, you may get used to it and actually like it.</p>
			<p>In addition, the Purple is very durable because of its gel grid that doesn’t soften and form impressions over time. This is great news if you’d like your mattress to look and feel as good as new years after you buy it. </p>
			<p>Lastly, the medium-firm support of the Purple works well for some lightweight or average-weight stomach and back sleepers.</p>
            <p>Heavier sleepers may not get enough support from the Grid, though, and stomach sleepers in particular tend to need a firmer sleep surface. </p>
