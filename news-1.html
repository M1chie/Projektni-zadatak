			<h2>Purple Innovation stock slammed after earnings as manufacturing issues hit mattress company</h2>n
			<p class="description">CEO calls results ‘disappointing,’ company plas to invest in supply-chain initiatives meant to boost margins next year.</p>
			<p>Shares of Purple Innovation Inc. were falling sharply in late trading Tuesday after the mattress company posted weaker-than-expected results, with management calling out a “manufacturing backlog.”</p>
			<p>The company generated third-quarter net income of $2.1 million, whereas it recorded a loss of $87.0 million a year prior. </p>
			<p>The company saw an adjusted loss per share of 7 cents, while it posted adjusted earnings per share of 27 cents in the year-earlier quarter. </p>
			<p>Purple PRPL, 3.07% saw net revenue decline to $170.8 million from $187.1 million a year earlier, while analysts were projecting $198.3 million.</p>
			<p>The company disclosed that it saw a 9.6% increase in wholesale revenue versus a year prior, though direct-to-consumer revenue was off 15.9%.</p>
			<p>Purple recently struck a new agreement with Mattress Firm. It has plans to open “270 new wholesale retail doors through the first five weeks of the fourth quarter,” Megibow noted in the release.</p>
			<p>The company anticipates net revenue for 2021 of $720 million to $740 million, while analysts had been projecting $818 million in full-year revenue prior to the report. </p>
			<p>Purple also anticipates that rising input costs and a bigger shift toward wholesale business are among factors that could pressure full-year gross margins.</p>
            <p>“Our third-quarter results were disappointing, largely driven by impacts from our manufacturing backlog that were longer-lasting than we anticipated,” Chief Executive Joe Megibow said in a release. </p>
