		<p>Purple is an American comfort technology company based in Lehi, Utah, USA. It specializes in the direct-to-consumer sale of mattresses, seat cushions, back cushions, pillows, and platform bases.</p>
		<p>Brothers Tony and Terry Pearce began by creating carbon fiber sporting goods and wheelchairs in 1989. In the following years, they created EdiZone, LLC and own 23 trademarks in cushioning materials, fluids, and hyper-elastic polymers. The patents are used in medical devices, shoes, and toys.</p>
		<p>In 2013, a patented machine was invented and named Mattress Max, which allowed them to create and mold large pieces of elastic polymers into mattresses. They went on to found Purple and started a Kickstarter campaign for a king-sized mattress which launched on September 23, 2015. Five days later the campaign reached its original goal amount of $25,000. On November 7, 2015 the Purple mattress campaign ended with 320 backers pledging $171,560.</p>
		<p>Purple partnered with The Harmon Brothers team to launch a series of videos that explain and demonstrate the science behind the mattress. Purple's videos and advertisements collected more than 100 million views.</p>
		<p>On July 27, 2017, Purple announced a merger with Global Partner Acquisition Corp (GPAC) at a $1.1 billion valuation. After the acquisition, the company was renamed Purple Innovation Inc.</p>
		<p>On December 13, 2021, after disappointing performance through 2021, Joseph B. Megibow resigned as CEO and from the Board of Directors of Purple Innovation. During Mr. Megibow's tenure, Purple's stock experienced wide swings, with a strong performance during 2019-2020. However, a series of industrial accidents during Mr. Megibow's tenure [9] cascaded with a series of poor quarterly performance and multiple earnings revisions resulted in Purple falling from an all-time high of $41.08 to just $9.80 as of Mr. Megibow's departure in 2021. Consequently, Purple's Board of Directors installed Rob DeMartini, Former CEO of New Balance and USA Cycling as interim CEO & as a member of the Board of Directors, with Mr. Megibow remaining on in an advisory role during a transition period of 6 months from his resignation.</p>
